Hello CSCI 4900/6600!

This is the RSA Encryption and Decryption Cyber Security Project
The RSA algorithm is named after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman who designed the algorithm in 1977.
Despite its age, it is still used widely today for its high level of security.
Its process involves the following key components:

Two prime numbers, p and q
Their product, n: p*q
Euler's Totient function, phi(n): (p-1) * (q-1)
Public exponent, e such that e is relatively prime to phi(n) and between 1 and phi(n) exclusive
Private exponent, d such that d is the modular multiplicative inverse to e and phi(n)

Once we have the following components, we have our private key and public key:
Private key: {d, n}
Public key: {e, n}

The encryption formula described in RSA as C = M^d (mod n)
The decryption formula is described in RSA as M = C^e (mod n)

Cracking the RSA algorithm becomes very difficult computationally as we increase bit size. While the computation of encryption may increase, its security grows exponentially.
